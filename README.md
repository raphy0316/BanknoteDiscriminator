Currency Identification:

When a banknote is presented to the activated camera, the app automatically identifies the denomination.
Voice Guidance:

The app provides real-time audio guidance, informing the user about the denomination of the presented banknote.
User Experience:
BillDiscriminator is meticulously designed with a user-centric approach, aiming to provide visually impaired individuals with an intuitive and seamless experience. This app empowers users to independently identify banknotes, fostering a sense of security and autonomy in their financial transactions.
